- Bugfix: limit to a maximum of 1024 exceptions avoiding huge logs. Logs this
  behavior (excessive exception count) as anomaly.
- Tweak: use a ringbuffer for unicode filepaths rather than allocating many
  dozens or even hundreds of kilobytes on the stack.
- Bugfix: long file path resolving (after many attempts).
- Bugfix: registry key path resolving (after many attempts).
- Bugfix: execution never finishing due to unhook detection threads.
- Dump instruction at exception address in debug mode.
- Exception handler; log exceptions with stacktraces.
- Introduce debug mode; attach a stacktrace to every logged API.
- Resolve registry key paths on-the-fly.
- "Ensure" blocks; avoid null pointer arguments in called APIs.
- Documentation.
- Special hooks; hook handlers for a specific API that are always invoked.
- Start on 64-bit support.
- Base monitor including hooking, logging, unhook detection.
